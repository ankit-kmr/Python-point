< Adding conversational intelligence using Azure Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)>
====================================================================================================
A  key factor in AI applications is the ability to interact intelligently with the user. -- can build conversational intelligence into your bot by using LUIS 
-- LUIS is an Azure Cognitive Services API that applies custom machine-learning intelligence .

<Language_Understanding_Intelligent_Service[LUIS]> :
Helps AI in understanding language as specific aspects(details) are critical to aiding(helping) the algorithm in making comparisons and distinctions --
maps the user's words, phrases, or sentences to tasks/actions the user wants to do.
It makes use of three key aspects for understanding language:
>>> Utterances : input from the user that the app needs to interpret.
>>> Intents	: represents a task or action -- goal/purpose expressed in a user's utterance.
>>> Entities : represents a word or phrase inside the utterance .
Ex :: "Book 2 tickets on a flight to New York for New Year's Eve." , In this utterance the entities New York is a Location , New Year Eve is classified 
as Event , number 2 is an prebuild entity/number.
